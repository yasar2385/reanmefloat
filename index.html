<div>Resource dependence theory (RDT) is the study of how the dependence on external resources of organizations

  influence the behavior of the organization. As the heading of this chapter perhaps already suggests, this will be a
  more theoretical <a class="xref" href="#FIGn-fig-20" ref-type="fig" rid="FIGn-fig-20">Figure 5.6</a>section with a
  contrasting view on why some organizational decision are made and how they fall in
  line with contemporary theoretical views. Beside the theoretical approach, this chapter also aims to explore the
  resource access strategies adopted by cultural centers operating in challenging business environments.

<div>The following chapter (ChapterÂ 7)
  <a class="xref" href="#FIGn-fig-21" ref-type="fig" rid="FIGn-fig-21">Figure 5.2</a>
  will focus on mission drift, which is the situation where the activities of<a class="xref" href="#FIGn-fig-22"
    ref-type="fig" rid="FIGn-fig-22">Figure 5.3</a>
  organizations drift away from its initial mission due to the aim of earning money. This chapter will have a slightly
  related focus, as it among other things deals with the concept of receiving revenues without letting these steers <a

<div>This chapter aims to point out that the dependence on diverse revenue sources among private cultural centers,<a
    class="xref" href="#FIGn-fig-19" ref-type="fig" rid="FIGn-fig-19">Figure 5.1</a>
  unlike their public counter peers, can lead to heterogeneity. To examine the need of diversified funding, we
  willexamine the following hypotheses together with the qualitative data. The hypotheses are:</div>
<div>H2: The type of perceived resource interdependence leads to a higher degree of resource diversification in
  privatecultural centers.H02: The type of perceived resource interdependence does not lead to a higher degree of
  resource diversification inprivate cultural centers.</div>
<div>To examine how the cultural centers perceive their interdependencies, this chapter focuses on the
  followinghypotheses.</div>
<div>The hypotheses are:4: Cultural centers in general have a manageable environmental interdependence.H04: Cultural
  centers in general do not have a manageable environmental interdependence.</div>
<div>The qualitative questions this chapter aims to focus on are how cultural centers perceive the concept of
  resourcedependence, and how they manage this dependency in practice. Before examining these viewpoints, this
  chapterwillshortly present the fundamentals of RDT.</div>
